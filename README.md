📖 Detailed Topic Overview
What are Data Structures and Algorithms? 📈
Understanding the fundamental concepts of how we organize data (data structures) and solve computational problems efficiently (algorithms). This section covers:

Definition and importance of DSA
Real-world applications
How to choose the right data structure
Algorithm design principles

Stacks 📚
LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) structure implementation and applications.

Use Cases: Undo operations, function call management, expression parsing
Operations: Push, Pop, Peek, isEmpty
Time Complexity: O(1) for all operations
Space Complexity: O(n)

Queues 🎟️
FIFO (First-In, First-Out) structure for ordered processing.

Use Cases: Task scheduling, printer queues, messaging systems, BFS traversal
Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, Front, isEmpty
Time Complexity: O(1) for all operations
Space Complexity: O(n)

Priority Queues 🥇
Queue variant where elements are served based on priority rather than insertion order.

Use Cases: Dijkstra's algorithm, task scheduling, A* pathfinding
Implementation: Binary heap, sorted array, linked list
Time Complexity: O(log n) insertion/deletion, O(1) peek

Linked Lists 🔗
Dynamic data structure with nodes connected via pointers.

Types: Singly, Doubly, Circular linked lists
Advantages: Dynamic size, efficient insertion/deletion
Disadvantages: No random access, extra memory overhead
Time Complexity: O(1) insertion/deletion at known position, O(n) search

Dynamic Arrays 🌱
Resizable arrays that automatically grow and shrink (like Python lists, Java ArrayList).

Features: Automatic resizing, random access, cache-friendly
Time Complexity: O(1) amortized insertion, O(1) access, O(n) worst-case insertion
Space Complexity: O(n)

LinkedLists vs ArrayLists 🤼‍♂️
Comprehensive comparison covering:

Access Time: Arrays O(1) vs Linked Lists O(n)
Insertion/Deletion: Context-dependent performance
Memory Usage: Array locality vs pointer overhead
Cache Performance: Arrays vs scattered memory allocation

Big O Notation 📈
Mathematical representation of algorithm efficiency:

Time Complexity: How runtime scales with input size
Space Complexity: How memory usage scales with input size
Common Complexities: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²), O(2ⁿ)
Best, Average, Worst Case Analysis

Searching Algorithms
Efficient methods to find elements in datasets:
